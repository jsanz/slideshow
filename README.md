iFrame Slideshow
=======================

Create a set of slides that render iframes and loops over them automatically.

Call http://jsanz.github.io/slideshow/?cartodb=user/table where

- `user` is your user name at [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com)
- `table` is a table on your CartoDB account with two columns: `url` and `title` to feed your slides. You can leave it blank if the table is named `slideshow`.

Things on the to-do list:

- Allow customization of the slideshow (autoloop, theming, time between slides, etc)
- I'll explore other options like passing a custom url or a CSV when I have more time.

Enjoy!
